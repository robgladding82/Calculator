# Calculator
 A simple calculator program in Python

This application is a very basic calculator function that allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, running in a loop until the user 
chooses to exit. The user is prompted to select an operation and enter 2 numeric values as operands. Invalid numerical inputs are handled and division by zero is prevented. 
At the end of each calculation the user is asked if they would like to perform another calculation and the program either loops or exits depending on their selection. If
the user enters an invalid input at the continuation prompt, they will be repeatedly asked until a valid input is entered.

This was one of the first projects I started in Python as a beginner, and it was useful for learning several foundational programming concepts. It helped me to understand 
how to create and use functions to encapsulate operations. It helped me to understand how to use conditional statements to control a programs logic, such as choosing an 
operation or validating an input. I had to learn how to handle errors in order to prevent the program from crashing, as well as incorporating loops to ensure that the 
program keeps running until the user chooses to exit. I learned how to validate some numeric and non-numeric input from the user, which is critical for robust, 
user-friendly applications. It also introduced methods which allow interaction with users, such as input().
